Hides the ugly red bar that the Valve/Microsoft trust is currently using to coerce people into downgrading to Bugcrash.

Removal is achieved by applying a (very basic) skin to the library.

### Installation
1. Download the current release and extract the archive somewhere.
2. Open explorer and navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`.
3. Create a folder named `skins` if it does not already exist.
4. Copy the extracted `Hide-Abandonment-Shit` folder into your `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins` folder.
5. Open Steam and look to the menu bar. Click on _Steam_, then _Settings_, then _Interface_.
6. Click on `< default skin >` and choose the new skin.
7. Restart Steam when prompted.

And voila, the title area is back to being nice and clean and free of coercion.
