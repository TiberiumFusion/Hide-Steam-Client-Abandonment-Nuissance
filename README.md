Hides the ugly red bar that the Valve/Microsoft trust is currently using to coerce people into downgrading to Bugcrash.

Removal is achieved by applying a (very basic) skin to the library.

### Installation
1. Open explorer and navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`.
2. Create a folder named `skins` if it does not already exist.
3. Download the [current release](https://github.com/TiberiumFusion/Hide-Steam-Client-Abandonment-Nuissance/releases/download/v1/Hide-Abandonment-Shit.Skin.v1.zip).
4. Extract the `Hide-Abandonment-Shit` folder into your `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins` folder. So the full path will now look like: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins\Hide-Abandonment-Shit\resource\...`
5. Open Steam and look to the menu bar. Click on _Steam_, then _Settings_, then _Interface_.
6. Click on `< default skin >` and choose the new skin. If you don't see the skin, you didn't copy it into `skins` properly.
7. Restart Steam when prompted.

And voila, the title area is back to being nice and clean and free of coercion.
